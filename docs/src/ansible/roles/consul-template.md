# Consul-template

This role deploys a new Consul-template instance.

## Prerequisites
- consul-template installed
- Access to any template destination directories

## Setup

[Vault-agent](./vault.md#vault-agent) is used to authenticate to Vault for
consul-template. It only requires access to the `vault_agent_token_file`. This
means consul-template requires access to Vault directories. It also requires
access to any template destination directories (eg. Consul, Nomad TLS
directories). As such, the role runs consul-template as root. I'm still
considering alternatives that allow consul-template to be ran as a
non-privileged user.

>**Note**: Vault and Vault-agent do not have to be installed for the role to run
>successfully. However, they must be available for the consul-template service
>to start without error.
